  {
    question: 'Does it cost more to use a buyer\'s agent for new construction homes in Las Vegas, Nevada?',
    answer: 'No—the commission is built into new construction home pricing whether you represent yourself or hire a buyer\'s agent. You\'re already paying for representation, so choose someone who protects YOUR interests. Dr. Jan Duffy, your buyer\'s agent, provides expert representation at no extra cost to you.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes buying new construction different from resale?',
    answer: 'New construction offers modern features, energy efficiency, builder warranties, and the ability to customize finishes. You also won\'t face bidding wars or need to compete with cash offers like in the resale market. Plus, builders are currently offering incentives like rate buy-downs and closing cost assistance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to build a new home?',
    answer: 'Construction timelines vary but typically range from 4-8 months depending on the home size, complexity, and builder schedule. Dr. Jan Duffy monitors construction every 7-10 days to keep you informed throughout the process.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What warranties come with a new construction home?',
    answer: 'New construction homes come with builder warranties covering structural defects (typically 10 years), major systems (2-5 years), and workmanship (1 year). Dr. Jan Duffy\'s building standards inspection at closing catches issues before your warranty matters.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I customize my new home?',
    answer: 'Yes, depending on the construction stage. If you purchase pre-construction, you may be able to select finishes, flooring, and other design elements. Dr. Jan Duffy can help you understand customization options available for your specific home.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What incentives are builders offering?',
    answer: 'Builders are currently offering incentives including mortgage rate buy-downs, closing cost assistance, price reductions, and upgrade packages. Dr. Jan Duffy, your buyer\'s agent, has insider knowledge of current builder incentives in Las Vegas, Nevada and can help you maximize your savings.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a down payment for new construction?',
    answer: 'Yes, though down payment requirements vary by loan type. FHA loans require as little as 3.5% down, conventional loans typically require 5-20% down, and VA loans offer 0% down for qualified veterans. Down payment assistance programs may also be available.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is construction monitoring and why do I need it?',
    answer: 'Construction monitoring involves regular inspections of your home during the build process. Dr. Jan Duffy monitors construction every 7-10 days, catching issues before your warranty expires. When the superintendent knows monitoring will happen, your home gets built right.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I get a home inspection on a new construction home?',
    answer: 'Yes! Even new homes can have issues. Dr. Jan Duffy provides a complimentary building standards inspection at closing that catches issues BEFORE your warranty matters, potentially saving you thousands in post-warranty repairs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I register with builders when buying new construction?',
    answer: 'It\'s crucial to register correctly with builders to ensure your buyer\'s agent representation. Dr. Jan Duffy, your buyer\'s agent, handles proper registration to protect your co-op benefits and ensure commission applies to your purchase. Call her BEFORE visiting model homes.',
