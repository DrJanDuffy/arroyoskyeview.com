    description: 'This no-commitment, knowledge-building exercise gives you insight into how much home you could probably afford, as well as which home loan type might be your best fit. All it requires is for a lender to take a snapshot of your finances and run a credit check. Prequalification is a powerful tool that will let you know exactly what steps you\'ll need to take before you\'re ready to purchase a home—if you\'re not there already! It also establishes a relationship with a lender, which will come in handy later on when you need preapproval to purchase a particular home',

      'You need a 20% down payment. Actually, most buyers don\'t. Some even qualify for zero-down loans.',

    description: 'One of the great advantages of new home construction is that it\'s first-come, first-served. As long as you\'re a qualified buyer, the house is yours if you\'re the one who got there first. When you\'ve found a home that checks the right boxes, you\'ll want to act fast to get it under contract—ensuring that no other buyer can swoop in and buy it out from under you.',
