    question: 'Does it cost more to use a buyer\'s agent for Arroyo at Skyeview Homes?',
    answer: 'No—builders pay for buyer representation on all new construction homes including Arroyo at Skyeview Homes. The commission is built into the home pricing whether you use an agent or not. You\'re already paying for representation, so choose someone who protects YOUR interests. Dr. Jan Duffy represents HOME BUYERS, not the builder. There\'s no extra cost to you.',

  {

She represents HOME BUYERS, not the builder. This means you get construction monitoring, building standards inspection, and insider knowledge—all at no extra cost.',
