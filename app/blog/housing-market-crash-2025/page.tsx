              If you've seen headlines or social posts calling for a housing crash, it's easy to wonder if home values are about to take a hit. But here's the simple truth.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              And sure, it's going to vary by local area. Some markets will see prices rise more than others. And some may even see small, short-term declines. But the big picture is: <strong>home prices are expected to rise nationally, not fall, over the next 5 years.</strong>

              The Real Story Is in the Expert Forecasts
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              In the <strong>Home Price Expectations Survey (HPES)</strong> from Fannie Mae, each quarter over 100 leading housing market experts weigh in on where they project home prices will go from here. And in the report that was just released, the experts agree prices are projected to climb nationally through at least 2029.

              Here's how to read this visual. Each bar in that graph shows an <strong>increase, not a loss</strong>. It's just that the anticipated pace of that appreciation varies year-to-year.

              And to further drive this home, let's look at another view of where prices are and where they're expected to go. In this version, the expert forecasts are broken into 3 categories: the overall average, the most optimistic projections, and the most pessimistic projections.

              How This Compares to "Normal" for the Market
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Now, focus back on the first graph. The projections call for <strong>2-3.5% price increases</strong> in each of the next five years. For context, the average rate of appreciation for the last 25 years was closer to <strong>4-5% annually</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              So, while that's slightly below the historical average, it's much more sustainable and typical than where the market was in 2020, 2021, and 2022.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Back then, prices rose too much, too fast based on record-low supply and record-high demand. Some places even saw prices climb by 15-20%.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              So, while it may feel like prices are stalling compared to those pandemic-era surges, <strong>what's really happening is that the market is finally finding balance again.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
              Why Prices Aren't Expected To Crash
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              A lot of the chatter about home prices today is based on that rapid rise and the old saying that what goes up, must come down. But historically, that's not really true. <strong>Home prices almost always rise.</strong>
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              And the main reason we're not heading for a repeat of 2008 is simple: <strong>supply and demand.</strong>
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Even though affordability challenges have made it harder for some people to buy over the past few years, there still aren't enough homes for everyone who wants one. And that ongoing shortage is keeping upward pressure on prices nationally.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 mb-8 rounded-r-lg">
              <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
                That's why experts across the board can confidently agree: we're not headed for a price collapse, but for steady, long-term appreciation.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              And just in case it's the economy that's got you worried, remember this. Over the past 50 years, there have been plenty of economic events that have impacted the market. And one thing that's consistently been true throughout time is <strong>the housing market always recovers</strong>. And we're coming through that turn right now and going into a recovery.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg p-8 mt-12 mb-8">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Bottom Line</h2>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                If you've been waiting to buy or sell because you're worried about a crash, it's time to look at the data – not the headlines.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">
                The question isn't if home prices will rise, it's by how much.
