            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              When lenders evaluate your mortgage application, they look at your <strong>debt-to-income (DTI) ratio</strong>. This is the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward paying debts, including student loans.
            </p>

                  <span className="text-blue-600 mr-2 font-bold">•</span>
                  <span>Most lenders prefer a DTI ratio of <strong>43% or lower</strong></span>

              Strategies for Homebuyers with Student Loans

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">1. Explore Income-Driven Repayment Plans</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  If you're on an income-driven repayment plan, your monthly student loan payment may be lower than the standard payment. Lenders typically use the actual payment amount shown on your statement, not the total loan balance.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Consider Refinancing</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Refinancing your student loans could lower your monthly payment, which improves your DTI ratio. However, be aware that this may affect your eligibility for federal loan benefits like forgiveness programs.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">3. Save for a Larger Down Payment</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A larger down payment reduces your monthly mortgage payment, which can help balance out your student loan payments in your DTI calculation.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">4. Work with a Knowledgeable Lender</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Not all lenders treat student loans the same way. Some lenders have programs specifically designed for borrowers with student debt. Work with a lender who understands your situation and can guide you through the process.
