              If there was one simple step that could help make your home sale a seamless process, wouldn't you want to know about it?
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              There's a lot that happens from the time your house goes under contract to closing day. And a few things still have to go right for the deal to go through. But here's what a lot of sellers may not know.
            </p>

                There's one part of the process where some homeowners are hitting a road bump that's causing buyers to back out these days. But don't worry. The majority of these snags are completely avoidable, especially when you understand what's causing them and how to be proactive.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              That's where a great agent (and a little prep) can make all the difference.

              What's Causing Some Buyers To Back Out
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The latest data from Redfin says <strong>15% of pending home sales are falling through</strong>. And that's not wildly higher than the 12% norm from 2017-2019. But it is an increase.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              That means roughly <strong>1 in 7 deals today don't make it to the closing table</strong>. But, at the same time, <strong>6 out of 7 do</strong>. So, the majority of sellers never face this problem – and odds are, you won't either. But you can help make it even less likely if you know how to get ahead.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              You might assume the main reason buyers are backing out today is financing. But that's actually not the case. <strong>The most common deal breaker today, by far, is inspection and repair issues</strong> (see graph below):

              Here's why that's a sticking point for buyers right now:
            </p>

            <ul className="space-y-4 mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
              <li className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-blue-600 mr-3 font-bold mt-1">•</span>
                <span><strong>Buyers are already stretched thin</strong> from high prices and challenging mortgage rates, so they don't have the appetite (or budget) for unexpected repairs.</span>

              <li className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-blue-600 mr-3 font-bold mt-1">•</span>
                <span>If they're going to spend all that money, <strong>they want to get something that's move-in ready</strong>. They don't want to take on another high-cost project themselves.</span>

                <span><strong>They have more homes to choose from</strong>, so if yours seems like a hassle or if you're not willing to fix something, they can just move on.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 mb-8 rounded-r-lg">
              <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
                The sellers with the best agents have heard about this shift and they're doing what they can to go in prepared. Enter the pre-listing inspection.

              What's a Pre-Listing Inspection?
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              It's exactly what it sounds like. It's a <strong>professional home inspection you schedule before your home hits the market</strong>. And while it's not required, the <strong>National Association of Realtors (NAR)</strong> explains why it could be a valuable step for some sellers right now:
            </p>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8 rounded-r-lg italic">
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800">
                "To keep deals from unraveling . . . it allows a seller the opportunity to address any repairs before the For Sale sign even goes up. It also can help avoid surprises like a costly plumbing problem, a failing roof or an outdated electrical panel that could cause financially stretched buyers to bolt before closing."
              </p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Think of it as a way to avoid future headaches. You'll know what issues could pop up during the buyer's inspection – and you'll have time to fix them or decide what to disclose before you put your house on the market.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 mb-8 rounded-r-lg">
              <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
                This way, when the buyer's inspector walks in, you're ready. No surprises. No last-minute panic. No deal on the line.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
              Is It Worth It?
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Generally speaking, a pre-listing inspection costs just a few hundred dollars. So, it's not a big expense. And the information it gives you is invaluable. But before you make that investment, <strong>talk to your local agent</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              In some markets, it may not be worth it. And in others, it may be the best move you can make. It all depends on what's happening where you are and what's working for other local sellers. If your agent recommends getting one, they'll also:
