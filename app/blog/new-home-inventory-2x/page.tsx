              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Builder rate buy-downs work by the builder paying upfront to reduce your mortgage interest rate for the first few years of your loan. For example, if market rates are 7%, a builder might buy down your rate to 5% for the first two years, then 6% for years three to five. This significantly reduces your monthly payment during the early years of homeownership, making new construction more affordable.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Many builders are offering closing cost assistance, which can cover thousands of dollars in fees associated with purchasing a home. This assistance reduces your upfront costs, making homeownership more accessible. Combined with rate buy-downs, these incentives can save you significant money both upfront and over time.

                Some builders are adjusting base prices to be more competitive, and many are offering free or discounted upgrades. These upgrades can include premium flooring, countertops, appliances, and design features that add value to your home. When combined with other incentives, these packages can significantly increase your home's value.

                  answer: 'New home inventory is 2x the normal because many homeowners are staying in their current homes due to low mortgage rates they don\'t want to give up. This has reduced resale inventory while builders have continued construction, creating higher new home inventory levels. Builders are responding with aggressive incentives to move inventory.',
